   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to sentry-jira's documentation
======================================

WIP

Documentation is currently a work in progress


Configuration
-------------


Go to your project's configuration page (Projects -> [Project]) and select the
JIRA tab. Enter the JIRA credentials and Project configuration and save changes.
Filling out the form is a two step process (one to fill in data, one to select
project).

Once the configuration is saved, you have the option of filling in raw field
names (comma separated) that you don't want displayed on the create form. This
is useful if you have plugins installed which use custom fields to store
additional data on Issues.
